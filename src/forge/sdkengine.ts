/**
 * The real engine behind the worker loop.
 *
 * `worker.ts` takes an engine rather than reaching for the SDK itself, so every specimen
 * runs against a fake stream and the suite spends nothing. This is the other
 * implementation: the one that actually opens a session.
 *
 * The options below are the ones that have cost a session today. A worker opened with an
 * inherited config directory writes into the store the interactive session is using, and
 * a login in either place changes what the other authenticates as. A worker that keeps
 * the nine inherited names saves no transcript, so nothing can read its context or its
 * cost afterwards. Neither looks like a failure from outside, which is why they are
 * asserted rather than trusted.
 *
 * The context a turn carried is `input + cache_read + cache_creation`. Reading
 * `input_tokens` alone reports single digits on a half-million-token turn, and that is
 * exactly how a session reached 543,000 tokens with nothing noticing.
